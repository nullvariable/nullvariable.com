          Slow sites are expensive
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Every fraction of a second longer that a site takes to load will impact how many users are willing to
          stick with your site. But slow sites also tend to use more processing cycles, make employee tasks unproductive
          and more.

            Scale
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
            Is it time to scale your project? Doug can help with identifying sticky points and reducing the cost of
            scaling.
            Maybe your project needs architectural review because it's not built with the cloud in mind. Doug's years of
            experience
            working with apps at scale can help with cloud based scaling problems too.
